# Overload.io
A silly little personal project to explore the correlation between heart rate and RPE using AI powered 3rd party API's while holding me accountable in progressively overloading my exercises. 

(manual improvement)
The goals of this project are to:
1. allow users to log custom exercise entries and/or log from a pre-defined selection of exercises
2. allow users to log their RPE and heart rate (heart rate calculation manually on user-end)
3. allow users to visualize their progress (set count, weight count)
4. allow users to ask for advice and receive feedback real-time

(recommended improvement)
Future Implementations:
1. call OpenAI API or Google Cloud AI to analyze patterns and provide feedback
2. connect with 3rd party API's like Apple Health Kit, FitBit API to integrate heart rate data
